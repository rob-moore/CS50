# Intro
This repository will hold a collection of both problem sets as well as small write ups for each of the weeks of Harvard's CS50 course as I go through it. I will probably end up separating the coding problem sets into their own folders for organizational purpourses unless that's not feasible as is the case with week 0's problem set of making a game in MIT's Scratch.

# CS50 Week 0
As I mentioned above, this week's lesson was mostly introductory. The professor gave a small talk on how to begin thinking like a programmer. This included an example of a basic algorithm that was put in place to help count how many people were in class. It also included an introduction to binary. Overall, this was well explained and easy to understand. I'm really looking forward to progressing with this class as the next week we will be jumping right into C. 

As for this week's problem set I was required to make a game in MIT's Scratch language. The requirements were:

```
* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.

* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.

* Your project must use at least one sound.
```

Here's what I came up with: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153333697/

It's a relatively simple game where you fly around as a ghost and avoid apples that fall from random positions. I was pretty pleased with how it turned out. It was interesting to troubleshoot some of the problems that I ran into, specifically trying to add some kind of hit detection for when the ghost hit an apple. Thankfully, Scratch is pretty easy to figure out and the lack of needing actual syntax made it really easy to try lots of different solutions to my problem.
